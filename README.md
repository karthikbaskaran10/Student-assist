# Student-assist
Project in java
STUDENTS ASSIST TOOL


This is a simple desktop application devloped in core JAVA paltform. Its main idea is to connect an institution's alumini with the students. 

The project demands a database created using mySQL using a XAMPP server. The name of the database to be created is "mydb". 

Four tables needs to be created. You can do it manully but it consumes a lot of time. So just import the "mydb.sql" file into your xampp server.

Register with as a new user.

The admin rights are given to a single person and the owner of this project can modify the admin id and password for data security.

All the information will be first updated in admin's database which makes this application more accurate and avoid duplicate entries.



Hope this project is helpful to all.
Thank you.
